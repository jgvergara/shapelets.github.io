              <br/>
                <p>Shapelets is an open-source platform created for time-series analysis. An open framework that empower users to leverage analytical capabilities in big data environments.</p>
                <p>Shapelets provides a handful of algorithms for time-series analysis coming up from the latest research in academia including <a href="https://github.com/shapelets/khiva">Khiva</a></p>
                <p>A platform that goes beyong anomaly detection offering more powerful analysis like motif and discord discovery, semantic segmentation, clustering, classification, rule discovery, etc.</a>.</p>
                <p>Shapelets makes the best of distributed systems and in-memory computing to accelerate machine learning using itâ€™s industry parallelized algorithms which take advantage of fine grained in-memory mapreduce.</p>
