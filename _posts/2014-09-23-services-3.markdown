Shapelets algorithms are the result of a thorough research process whereby each algorithm is selected based on applicability concerns and computation efficiency. Data series analysis is a field that demands extensive computational power; therefore, the engineering team is committed to deliver solutions that take maximum benefit of the resources available. Our code base runs on CUDA GPUs, OpenCL and multicore backends.
