  <p>Shapelets provides a handful of algorithms for time-series analysis coming up from the latest research in academia including our <a href="https://github.com/shapelets/khiva">Khiva library</a></p>.
  <p>Shapelets is trained to recognise distinct types of data series and, automatically, select the best algorithms for the task at hand. We call it CAML, Computer Aided Machine Learning, and offers users intelligent recipes for analytical workloads like clustering, classification, forecasting, and semantical segmentation, based on the data series shape and features.</p>
